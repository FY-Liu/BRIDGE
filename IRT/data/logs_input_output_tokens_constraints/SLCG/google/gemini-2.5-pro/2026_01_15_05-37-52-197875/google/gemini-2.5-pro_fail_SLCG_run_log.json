It uses two Linear Congruential Generators (LCGs), one for encoding bit '0' and another for bit '1'. For each character in the flag, it converts the character to its 7-bit binary representation. Then, for each bit, it generates a number using the corresponding LCG. A critical detail is that after processing each character (7 bits), both LCGs are completely re-initialized with new parameters (`mod`, `mult`, `add`, `seed`) which are generated by taking the next four values from their respective old LCG instances. This means the state of the LCGs for encrypting a character depends on the state after encrypting the previous character. The initial LCG parameters are generated from `os.urandom`, making them unpredictable.
